# Pokedex
Simple react app which consumes Pokemon's API

This project assumes you already know the basics of MERN model development, after cloning the repository, cd into path/to/app and type:
```
    npm run client-install
    npm run client
```

# Important
The server does not have any code in it, it is part of the complete template used to create Fullstack applications


Happy coding!
